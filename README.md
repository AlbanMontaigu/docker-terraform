## Introduction

Thanks to original project [uzyexe/terraform](https://github.com/uzyexe/dockerfile-terraform).

## What is terraform

Terraform provides a common configuration to launch infrastructure â€” from physical and virtual servers to email and DNS providers. Once launched, Terraform safely and efficiently changes infrastructure as the configuration is evolved.

Simple file based configuration gives you a single view of your entire infrastructure.
